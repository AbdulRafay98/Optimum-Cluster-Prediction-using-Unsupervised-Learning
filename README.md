# Optimum-Cluster-Prediction-using-Unsupervised-Learning


The goal of this project is to find optimum number of clusters using unsupervised learning technique on the Iris datasets.

* Used KMeans clustering algorithm for training with multiple number of cluser size,
* Used Elbow Method to visualize clustesrs segmentation with errors.
* Used normalization to scale data into 0-1 range to get better result.
* Retrained the clustering algorithm with best clustering size that minimizes error.
